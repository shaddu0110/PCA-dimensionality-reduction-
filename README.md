Dimensionality reduction technique using PCA (Unsupervised Learning )
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Census Data Exploration
•	Objective: Reduced dimensionality of Census 2011 data to identify key components explaining variance for meaningful insights.
•	Tasks & Techniques: 
o	Performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on demographic variables.
o	Applied z-score normalization, analyzed covariance matrices, and computed eigenvalues/vectors.
o	Identified principal components covering at least 90% variance using scree plots.
o	Interpreted principal components in terms of demographic variables, deriving a linear equation for the primary PC.
•	Outcome: Simplified data representation, enabling better understanding of population characteristics.
